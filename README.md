# Grow Habits API ðŸª´

## Overview

Welcome to the Grow Habits API ! This API allows users to create and track their habits, providing a structured way to cultivate positive routines in their daily lives.

## Features

- **Create Habits**: Users can create and define habits, specifying details such as name, cue, craving, response, and reward.

- **Track Habits**: Once habits are created, users can track their daily progress by completing tracked habits associated with each habit.

- **Completion Validation**: The API ensures that completion dates are valid, not in the future, and not before the habit's start date.

- **User Authentication**: Users need to be authenticated to create and track habits, ensuring secure access to personal habit data.
